		if a constructor created with parameters, default one is dismissed unless explicitly indicated.
		final method is non overridable !!!!
		private constructor => singleton
		getInstance() instead
		Classame.single !!! 
		.equals() check memory locations
		.hashCode -> unique return
		return this == other;
		gethashes(Object... objs){
		o.hashcode() => maybe useful ?=>polymorphism
		abstract classes-> container classes but with undefined methods, only names
		abstract class of toString is good
		implementation is useful
		//add employee dealership ?
		final class is not extendible
